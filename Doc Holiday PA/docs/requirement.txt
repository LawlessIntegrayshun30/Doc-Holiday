Develop or put together a well-rounded Ai model that I can install locally and use an open source API or my OpenAI API.  The model will be my personal assistant with agents that can perform various tasks, including personal tasks on the internet.  I want integration with my local files and Windows 10 system.  I want to be able to speak to my computer and have the model respond, in kind, and then execute.  Include a robust "read me" file (not a generator, i need the actual file), and make the package as complete as possible so that I don't have to add a bunch of coding that should be in it already.  It should be LAUNCH READY in the CI.  Also include a ci.yaml file instead of json for the requirements.  The personal assistant should have a simple UI with the capability to add folders and files, the option for autonomy and inference settings.  Also, i want no biases so it should be what is called an "uncensored" model.  I want it to learn from our interactions, what my morals and values are and what is ethically mandated in my environment.
