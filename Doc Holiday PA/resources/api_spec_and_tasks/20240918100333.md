## Shared Knowledge

'main.py' serves as the entry point and orchestrates the interaction between VoiceInterface, FileManager, LearningModel, and UI classes.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement for an 'uncensored' model is ambiguous. It is unclear how the AI should handle potentially harmful or illegal requests while being 'uncensored'. Further clarification is needed on the ethical constraints and how the AI should learn and adapt to the user's morals and values. The specifics of the continuous integration process in the CI environment are assumed to be using GitHub Actions, but this should be confirmed. Additionally, the extent of the AI's autonomy and inference settings customization needs to be defined.
