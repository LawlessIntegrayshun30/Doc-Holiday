## Original Requirements

Develop or put together a well-rounded Ai model that I can install locally and use an open source API or my OpenAI API.  The model will be my personal assistant with agents that can perform various tasks, including personal tasks on the internet.  I want integration with my local files and Windows 10 system.  I want to be able to speak to my computer and have the model respond, in kind, and then execute.  Include a robust "read me" file (not a generator, i need the actual file), and make the package as complete as possible so that I don't have to add a bunch of coding that should be in it already.  It should be LAUNCH READY in the CI.  Also include a ci.yaml file instead of json for the requirements.  The personal assistant should have a simple UI with the capability to add folders and files, the option for autonomy and inference settings.  Also, i want no biases so it should be what is called an "uncensored" model.  I want it to learn from our interactions, what my morals and values are and what is ethically mandated in my environment.

## Project Name

personal_assistant_ai

## Product Goals

- Develop a highly interactive and responsive AI personal assistant that integrates with local system and files
- Ensure the AI assistant is user-friendly with a simple UI and can perform tasks autonomously based on user preferences
- Create a robust and comprehensive documentation to facilitate easy installation and usage without additional coding

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to interact with my AI assistant using voice commands to perform tasks on my behalf
- As a user, I want the AI assistant to understand and execute commands related to file management on my Windows 10 system
- As a user, I want to customize the AI's autonomy and inference settings to align with my personal ethics and values

## Competitive Analysis

- Cortana: Integrated with Windows but limited in personal task automation
- Google Assistant: Highly interactive but requires internet and not uncensored
- Siri: Good for Apple ecosystem, not suitable for Windows integration
- Amazon Alexa: Customizable skills but not designed for deep local system integration
- Braina: Offers good Windows integration but lacks uncensored learning capabilities
- Jarvis: Customizable AI assistant but with complex setup procedures
- Mycroft: Open source and privacy-focused but requires additional hardware

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires the development of an AI personal assistant that can be installed locally and operate independently of the internet. It must integrate with the user's local files and Windows 10 system, and be capable of voice interaction. The assistant should be able to learn and adapt to the user's moral and ethical values without any pre-existing biases. A simple UI for managing files and folders is necessary, along with detailed documentation for easy setup. The assistant should be ready for continuous integration with a ci.yaml file.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop voice recognition and response system for interaction with the AI assistant']
- ['P0', 'Integrate AI assistant with local file system and Windows 10 environment']
- ['P0', "Implement a learning algorithm that adapts to user's morals and values"]
- ['P1', 'Design a simple and intuitive UI for file and folder management']
- ['P1', "Create comprehensive 'read me' documentation and ci.yaml file for easy setup and deployment"]

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a minimalist design with a focus on ease of use. It will include a voice command input area, a display for the assistant's responses, and a file management interface. The settings menu will offer customization options for autonomy and inference.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement for an 'uncensored' model needs further clarification regarding the extent of learning from user interactions and ethical constraints. Additionally, the specifics of the continuous integration process in the CI environment need to be defined.
